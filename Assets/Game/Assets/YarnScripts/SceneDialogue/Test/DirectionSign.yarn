Ralph: Ahh~ 
Ralph: It's good to be back. This place sure never changes.
// JOHAN (Ghost NPC)
Johan: Eh, I don't think a 6 months is that long, especially for anything for a place like this to drastically change.
// RALPH 
Ralph: But you never know! I practically revisit Europe and it has changed tenfold since the last time I visited.
Ralph: Rivers here are definitely has gotten smaller within these last 3 decades.
// JOHAN
Johan: Speaking of which, how was your trip to Norway
// RALPH 
Ralph: Still breathtaking as always
Ralph: Me and the Hiking group did a whole back to back, coast to coast, peak to peak
Ralph: Ahh good times.
Ralph: Oh though it did remind me of the time-
// JOHAN
Johan: Uh, is it me or that person looks like they are listening to us
// RALPH turns notice Corinne and turns back
Ralph: Oh that's Corinne, one of the employees.
Ralph: They are probably the only living that can see us. 
Johan: Huh. The more you know I guess.
Corinne: I'm sorry that I am eavdropping for a bit. Just making sure you are not planing on anything, or especially going mess with the building. 
Ralph: You don't have to worry about us causing any problems, we are just some old souls catching up.
// CORINNE
Corinne: Okay, just checking. I will leave you to two be then.
